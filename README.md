Overview

Landslide susceptibility modeling is a critical tool for understanding and predicting landslide-prone areas. In this project, we use ANN and XGB machine learning algorithms to build a susceptibility model based on various causative factors influencing landslides in the Upper Bhagirathi basin. The model is evaluated using key performance metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy to ensure robustness.

Key Features

Data Preparation:

Process geospatial data and compile various landslide causative factors such as slope, aspect, land use, soil type, and rainfall.
Multicollinearity Analysis: Perform multicollinearity analysis using Pearson correlation to identify and remove highly correlated variables, improving model performance.

Modeling Algorithms:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for complex, nonlinear pattern recognition.
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) for gradient-boosted decision trees, offering high accuracy and performance.
Accuracy Assessment: Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and other relevant metrics for reliable landslide susceptibility prediction
