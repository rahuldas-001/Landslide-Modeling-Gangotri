Landslide Susceptibility Modeling of the Upper Bhagirathi Basin

This repository contains code for modeling the landslide susceptibility of the Upper Bhagirathi basin using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithms. The workflow comprehensively covers every aspect of susceptibility modeling, from data preparation to model evaluation.

Overview


Landslide susceptibility modeling is a critical tool for understanding and predicting landslide-prone areas. In this project, we use ANN and XGB machine learning algorithms to build a susceptibility model based on various causative factors influencing landslides in the Upper Bhagirathi basin. The model is evaluated using key performance metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy to ensure robustness.
