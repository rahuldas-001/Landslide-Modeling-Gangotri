# 🌍 Landslide Susceptibility Modeling with Explainable AI (XAI)

This repository contains the complete pipeline for landslide susceptibility modeling using machine learning (XGBoost, MLP) and SHAP for model interpretation, as described in our paper:

**"Explainable Landslide Susceptibility Modeling using XGBoost and SHAP"**

---

## 📦 Features

- Preprocessing of landslide-related geospatial data
- Training ML models (XGBoost, MLP)
- SHAP summary and dependence plots
- Loss curves for model comparison
- Fully reproducible and well-documented

---

## 🖥️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahuldas-001/Landslide-Model-Gangotri.git
cd Landslide-Model-Gangotri

---

## 🚀 Quick Start via Google Colab

No installation needed! Run the entire model pipeline directly in your browser using Google Colab.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/landslide-model/blob/main/notebooks/landslide_model_walkthrough.ipynb)

### Steps:
1. Click the **"Open in Colab"** badge above.
2. Make sure you're signed into your Google account.
3. If prompted, allow Colab to access your Google Drive (optional: for saving results).
4. Run each cell in the notebook from top to bottom.
5. You’re done! 🎉

📌 **Note**: Make sure the Colab notebook has access to all necessary files, either by:
- Including sample data in the repo
- Hosting full datasets via a shareable Google Drive or Zenodo link
