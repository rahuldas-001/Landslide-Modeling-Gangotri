# 🌍 Landslide Susceptibility Modeling with Explainable AI (XAI)

This repository contains the complete pipeline for landslide susceptibility modeling using machine learning (XGBoost, MLP) and SHAP for model interpretation, as described in our paper:

**"Explainable Landslide Susceptibility Modeling using XGBoost and SHAP"**

---

## 📦 Features

- Preprocessing of landslide-related geospatial data
- Training ML models (XGBoost, MLP)
- SHAP summary and dependence plots
- Loss curves for model comparison
- Fully reproducible and well-documented

---
